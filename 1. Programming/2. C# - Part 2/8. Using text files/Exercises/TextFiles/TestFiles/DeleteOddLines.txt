In computer science, the maximum subarray problem is the task of 
finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array 
of numbers (containing at least one positive number) which has 
the largest sum. For example, for the sequence of values -2, 1, 
?3, 4, -1, 2, 1, ?5, 4; the contiguous subarray with the largest 
sum is 4, -1, 2, 1, with sum 6.

The problem was first posed by Ulf Grenander of Brown University 
in 1977, as a simplified model for maximum likelihood estimation 
of patterns in digitized images. A linear time algorithm was found
 soon afterwards by Jay Kadane of Carnegie-Mellon University 
(Bentley 1984).start
