finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array 
the largest sum. For example, for the sequence of values -2, 1, 
sum is 4, -1, 2, 1, with sum 6.
The problem was first posed by Ulf Grenander of Brown University 
of patterns in digitized images. A linear time algorithm was found
(Bentley 1984).start
